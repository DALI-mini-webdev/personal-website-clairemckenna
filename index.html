        Hello! My name is Sienna Henderson, I am currently a 23 at Dartmouth studying
        photography. For my first assignment, I took pictures of trees around my house.
        On this website, I will continually update and share my photographs so that my professor
        can view them all in one place. I hope you enjoy!!
